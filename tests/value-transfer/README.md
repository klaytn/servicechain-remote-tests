# This is for testing service chain value transfer.

## Bash environment variables
- The bridgeInfo variable sets a bridge-info.json file. The bridge-info.json is located config directory. It was generated by [make-bridge-info.sh](../../servicechain-docker/bridge-info/make-bridge-info.sh) 
- The parentBuildPath variable sets the build directory where the bin and abi files are located. This build directory is for parent chain.
- The childBuildPath variable sets the build directory where the bin and abi files are located. This build directory is for child chain.
- The transferConfig variable sets a transfer-config.json file. This transfer-config.json file is automatically generated by xxx-deploy.js like erc20-deploy.js.

## Node.js Version
- Used node version as v12.22.10

## ERC-20
- The run_testcase.sh script executes scripts ERC20-deploy.js, ERC20-transfer-1step.js and ERC20-transfer-2step.js in sequence. ERC20-deploy.js deploys bridge contract and token contract in parent chain and child chain. One-step uses requestValueTransfer() function. Two-step uses approve() and requestERC20Transfer() functions.
